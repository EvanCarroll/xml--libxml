XML::LibXML
===========

This module implements much of the DOM Level 2 API as an 
interface to the Gnome libxml2 library. This makes it a fast
and highly capable validating XML parser library, as well as
a high performance DOM.

Installation
============

Prior to installation you MUST have installed the libxml2
library.

Then run:

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make test
 $ su
 $ make install

Parser documentation is in perldoc XML::LibXML. DOM documentation
starts in perldoc XML::LibXML::Document and perldoc
XML::LibXML::Node.

This is free software, you may use it and distribute it under the same
