XML::LibXML
===========

This module implements much of the DOM Level 2 API as an 
interface to the Gnome libxml2 library. This makes it a fast
and highly capable validating XML parser library, as well as
a high performance DOM.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============

XML::LibXML was almost entirely reimplemented between version 1.40 
to version 1.49. This may cause problems on some production machines.
with version 1.50 a lot of compatibility fixes were applied, so 
programs written for XML::LibXML 1.40 or less should run with 
version 1.50 again.

Installation
============

Prior to installation you MUST have installed the libxml2
library. You can get the latest libxml2 version from 

      http://xmlsoft.org

Then run:

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make test
 $ su
 $ make install

Parser documentation is in perldoc XML::LibXML. DOM documentation
starts in perldoc XML::LibXML::Document and perldoc
XML::LibXML::Node.

If your libxml2 installation is not within your $PATH. you can set 
the environment variable XMLPREFIX=$YOURLIBXMLPREFIX to make 
XML::LibXML recognize the correct libxml2 version in use.

e.g.

$ XMLPREFIX=/usr/brand-new perl Makefile.PL

will ask '/usr/brand-new/bin/xml2-config' about your real 
libxml2 configuration.

NOTES FOR HPUX
==============

XML::LibXML requires libxml2 2.4.20 or later. That means the current
binary libxml2 package for HPUX cannot be used with XML::LibXML. For
some reasons the HPUX cc will not compile libxml2 correct, which will
force you to recompile perl with gcc (if you havn't already done that).

Additionally I got these Note from Rozi Kovesdi:

> Here is my report if someone else runs into the same problem:
>
> Finally I am done with installing all the libraries and XML Perl
> modules
>
> The combination that worked best for me was:
> gcc
> GNU make
>
> Most important - before trying to install Perl modules that depend on
> libxml2:
>
> must set SHLIB_PATH  to include  the path to  libxml2 shared library
> 
> assuming that you used the default:
>
> export  SHLIB=/usr/local/lib
>
> also, make sure that the config  files have execute permission:
>
> /usr/local/bin/xml2-config
> /usr/local/bin/xslt-config
> 
> they did not have +x after they were installed by 'make install'
> and it took me a while to realize that this was my problem
> 
> or one can use:
> 
> perl Makefile.PL LIBS='-L/path/to/lib' INC='-I/path/to/include'
