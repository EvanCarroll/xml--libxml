XML::LibXML
===========

This module implements much of the DOM Level 2 API as an 
interface to the Gnome libxml2 library. This makes it a fast
and highly capable validating XML parser library, as well as
a high performance DOM.

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============

XML::LibXML was almost entirely reimplemented between version 1.40 
to version 1.49. This may cause problems on some production machines.
with version 1.50 a lot of compatibility fixes were applied, so 
programs written for XML::LibXML 1.40 or less should run with 
version 1.50 again.

Installation
============

Prior to installation you MUST have installed the libxml2
library. You can get the latest libxml2 version from 

      http://xmlsoft.org

Then run:

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make test
 $ su
 $ make install

Parser documentation is in perldoc XML::LibXML. DOM documentation
starts in perldoc XML::LibXML::Document and perldoc
XML::LibXML::Node.

If your libxml2 installation is not within your $PATH. you can set 
the environment variable XMLPREFIX=$YOURLIBXMLPREFIX to make 
XML::LibXML recognize the correct libxml2 version in use.

e.g.

$ XMLPREFIX=/usr/brand-new perl Makefile.PL

will ask '/usr/brand-new/bin/xml2-config' about your real 
libxml2 configuration.
