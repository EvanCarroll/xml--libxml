for the next release:

* Add information about nested parsers in callbacks to the documenation.
* add namespace normalization. 
* corrected catalog support
* parsed DTD for parser validation.



I plan the following issues to implemented soon

* better DTD Support
* more flexible parser interface (in the binding)
* better module support (for shared code with other XS modules using libxml2)

* xmlReader Interface.
* structured Error support (Petr Pajas)
