I plan the following issues to implemented soon

* interface to the canolization implementation
* better DTD Support
* Interface to the schemainterface
* corrected catalog support
* more flexible parser interface (in the binding)
* better module support (for shared code with other XS modules using libxml2)

* xmlReader Interface.
* RelaxNG, libxml2 Regex interface.
* structured Error support (Petr Pajas)
